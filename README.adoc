= Platform Engineering Game Night Polls

This is a for-fun project I'm using as a test for AI tooling.

A web application for creating and managing polls for game night events. This
application is built using Rust with the Rocket framework as an MVC
application.

== Features

* User authentication and authorization
* Poll creation with multiple options
* Support for date/time options in polls
* Real-time poll results
* User management for administrators
* Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint

== Prerequisites

* Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)

== Setup and Installation

. Clone the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-night-web.git
cd game-night-web
----

. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (or use the existing `.env` file):
+
[source,bash]
----
cp .env.example .env
----

. Generate a secure key for the Rocket secret:
+
[source,bash]
----
openssl rand -base64 32
----

. Update the `ROCKET_SECRET_KEY` in the `.env` file with the generated key.

. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

== Troubleshooting

=== Database Connection Issues

If you encounter an error about not being able to open the database file, ensure:

. You're running the application from the project root directory, not from inside the `src/` directory
. The DATABASE_URL in your .env file is correctly set to `sqlite:./game_night.db`
. The directory where the application is running has write permissions

=== Template Engine Issues

This project uses Tera as its template engine. If you encounter template parsing errors:

. Avoid using the ternary operator (`? :`) in templates, as it's not supported in Tera
. Instead of `value | ternary('a', 'b')`, use:
+
----
{% if value %}a{% else %}b{% endif %}
----

. The `round` filter doesn't accept parameters in Tera (use `| round` instead of `| round(1)`)
. For conditional classes, use:
+
----
<div class="base-class {% if condition %}extra-class{% endif %}">
----

== Default Admin Account

The application is initialized with a default admin account:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please change the default admin password after the first login for security reasons.
====

=== Resetting Admin Password

If you need to reset the admin password, you can use one of the provided scripts:

==== Using Python (Recommended)

[source,bash]
----
# Reset to default 'admin' password
python3 reset_admin_password.py

# Or set a custom password
python3 reset_admin_password.py your_new_password
----

Requirements:

* Python 3
* bcrypt package (`pip install bcrypt`)

==== Using Bash

[source,bash]
----
# Reset to default 'admin' password
./reset_admin_password.sh

# Or set a custom password
./reset_admin_password.sh your_new_password
----

Requirements:

* sqlite3 command-line tool
* Python 3 with bcrypt (for password hashing)

These scripts will update the password for the existing admin user or create the admin user if it doesn't exist.

== Database

The application uses SQLite as its database. The database file is created automatically when the application is first run. Database migrations are applied automatically during application startup.

== Metrics

The application exposes a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint at `/metrics` which can be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring.

== Development

=== Running in Development Mode

[source,bash]
----
# Must be run from the project root directory
cargo run
----

=== Running Tests

[source,bash]
----
cargo test
----

=== Building for Production

[source,bash]
----
cargo build --release
----

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/game-night-web`.
